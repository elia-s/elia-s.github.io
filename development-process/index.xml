      <description>Code Versioning and Working Practice  The code of the MIP is versioned into Github. Each project should contain at least a master branch and a stable branch. The stable branch should contain only strongly tested code that can be used in a production environment. The master branch should contain the latest working features that needs to be strongly tested before being merged to the stable branch. Each developer should create new branches (usually from the master branch) to implement new features and/or to fix bugs.</description>
